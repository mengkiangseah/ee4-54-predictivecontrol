function [H,G] = myCostMatrices(Gamma,Phi,Q,R,P,N)
%% cost function matrices
% Gamma and Phi are the prediction matrices
% Q is the stage cost weight on the states, i.e. x'Qx
% R is the stage cost weight on the inputs, i.e. u'Ru
% P is the terminal weight on the final state

% your code here
H=1;
G=1;
