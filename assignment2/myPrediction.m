function [Gamma,Phi] = myPrediction(A,B,N)
% MYPREDICTION  [Gamma,Phi] = myPrediction(A,B,N). 
% A and B are discrete-time state space matrices for x[k+1]=Ax[k]+Bu[k]
% N is the horizon length. 
% Your code is suppose to work for any linear system, not just the gantry crane. 

% your code here:
Gamma = 1;
Phi = 1;
end
